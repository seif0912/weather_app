##### what did i learn?

- chart js : temperature data visualization

Responsive weather app. This project is inspired by Microsoft weather. I used the API from weatherapi.com. By default, the weather is in your position. You can also search for a specific city and you have the ability to pin it in your local storage and remove it. the weather information contains hourly and 3-day forecasts with the ability to change the unit system (Metric / American). For the summary graph, I used Chart.js. it took me 2 weeks to finish.
