##### what did i learn?

- chart js : temperature data visualization

Responsive weather app. This project is inspired by microsoft weather. I used the API from weatherapi.com. By default the weather is in your position. You can also search for a specific city and you have the ability to pin it in you local storage and remove it. the weather information contains hourly and 3 day forecast with the ability to change the unite system (metric / american). For the summary graph, I used Chart.js. it took me 2 weeks to finish.
